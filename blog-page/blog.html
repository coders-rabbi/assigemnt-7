                Difference between foreach, map, filter and find in javascript?
            </h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Ans:</strong> The forEach() method calls a function for each element in an array. map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element. The find() method returns the value of the first element that passes a test. The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function.

                Difference between local storage and session storage in javascript ?
            </h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Ans:</strong>Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data. Session storage is similar to cookies, but the data is only stored for the current session. This means that the data will be deleted when the user closes the browser.
